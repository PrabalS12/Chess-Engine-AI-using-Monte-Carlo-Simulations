_This Repository dwelves into the development and implementation of the Monte Carlo Algorithm for Chess Engine AI_

Monte Carlo algorithm follows a probabilistic explore-exploit strategy on the principles of Upper Confidence Bound for the selection simulation and then follows the principle of reinforcement learning to reward or punish itself once the final node of game termination is explored after rollout phase.
